Overview:
The game is like a Tamagotchi game, but with League of Legends champions
as pet!
Player gets to randomly hatch a pet out of three possible species from
an egg. As time goes on, player's responsibilities are to interact with
the pet through feeding food, providing medicines and playing mini-games
with the pet. Player can check status of pet at anytime to keep track of
 pet's status.

What player can do:
- Start the game by hatching a random pet. (Teemo, Yuumi, Fizz)
- Check pet's status:  name, birth date, hunger level(/100), happiness
level(/100), health level(/100), health status(Healthy/Sick).
- Feed pet: provide pet with three kinds of food. Note: different pet
has different favorite food which restores more hunger stats!
- Provide medicine: provide medicine to restore pet's health.
- Play mini-games: play rock, paper and scissors, and hide and seek with
the pet to increase pet's happiness.
- Restart game by hatching a new pet after a pet dies.
